This is a [scalaj-react](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react) application. Which uses [Diode](https://github.com/suzaku-io/diode) for immutable model structure for the application state.
A very good resource to understand how these interact with each other and in general scalajs setup [scalajs-spa-tutorial](https://ochrons.github.io/scalajs-spa-tutorial/en/) is a recommended read.
